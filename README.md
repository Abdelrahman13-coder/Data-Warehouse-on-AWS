# Data-Warehouse-on-AWS

### **Project Overview**
> A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
> Building ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transform data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team.




### **In addition to the data files the project workspace includes four files:**

* `create_table.py` is where you'll create your fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
* `etl.py` is where you'll load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.
* `sql_queries.py` is where you'll define you SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.
* `README.md` is where you'll provide discussion on your process and decisions for this ETL pipeline.


### **Project Datasets**
Their are two datasets that resides in **S3**. Here are the S3 links for each:
* Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
* Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

Log data json path:
`s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

#### **Song Dataset**
> The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`

`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
#### **Log Dataset**
> The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

> The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

### **Project Steps**

#### **Create Table Schemas**
1. Design schemas for your fact and dimension tables
2. Write a SQL `CREATE` statement for each of these tables in `sql_queries.py`
3. Complete the logic in `create_tables.py` to connect to the database and create these tables
4. Write SQL `DROP` statements to drop tables in the beginning of `create_tables.py` if the tables already exist. This way, you can run `create_tables.py` whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline.
5. Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3.
6. Add redshift database and IAM role info to `dwh.cfg`.
```
[CLUSTER]
HOST=redshift-cluster-1.************.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com
DB_NAME=dev
DB_USER=awsuser
DB_PASSWORD=**********
DB_PORT=5439

[IAM_ROLE]
ARN= arn:aws:iam::************:role/dwhRole

[S3]
LOG_DATA='s3://udacity-dend/log_data'
LOG_JSONPATH='s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json'
SONG_DATA='s3://udacity-dend/song_data'
```
7. Test by running `create_tables.py` and checking the table schemas in your redshift database. You can use Query Editor in the AWS Redshift console for this.

#### **Build ETL Pipeline**
1. Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
2. Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
3. Test by running `etl.py` after running `create_tables.py` and running the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare your results with the expected results.
4. Delete your redshift cluster when finished.
